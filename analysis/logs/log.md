# Weekly/Bi-Weekly Log

Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

## üóì Date:
## Week 1 ‚Äì April 14, 2025

‚è± Number of hours:
~18‚Äì20 hours
(News fetching, ticker extraction, FinBERT sentiment analysis, yfinance integration for historical price data)

üåπ Rose ‚Äì Highlight of the week:
Successfully created an automated pipeline to fetch financial news from NewsAPI, extract S&P 500 stock tickers using NLP (SpaCy), and analyze sentiment using FinBERT. The pipeline produced a meaningful output showing dominant sentiment and sentiment score per mentioned stock ticker ‚Äî a huge milestone for the Stocex project!
We have also filtered and selected tickers having average sentiment score of >0.98.
Additonally we have saved data into csv for future use in SEA analysis.

üå± Bud ‚Äì Looking forward to:
Integrating forecasting with Chronos or TimeGPT, and combining those forecasts with sentiment scores to build real-time trading signals. There's a strong potential here to generate actionable insights based on news-driven movement, and this will be crucial in moving towards the live signal dashboard.

ü•Ä Thorn ‚Äì Challenges:
Slight ambiguity in matching company names from the headlines with tickers (string matching wasn‚Äôt always perfect).

Loading chronos-ts failed locally ‚Äî had to revert to TimeGPT for now.

Fetching intraday data from yfinance is slightly slow and sometimes flaky for certain tickers.

üí≠ Additional thought:
Make sure to modularize the functions and package the full Steps 1‚Äì4 logic cleanly, so this pipeline can run automatically every morning. Also consider caching or saving results (e.g., yesterday‚Äôs news and sentiment_df) locally or in S3 to avoid reprocessing. This will help scale better when moving toward the alert and visualization stages.

## üóì Date:
## Week 2 ‚Äì April 26, 2025

‚è± Number of hours:
~20‚Äì22 hours
(Finalizing forecasting integration, SEA preparation, Streamlit prototype creation)

üåπ Rose ‚Äì Highlight of the week:
Integrated TimeGPT forecasting into the Stocex pipeline, enabling next 7-day price predictions based on historical stock data.
Successfully processed the full workflow: fetching financial news ‚û°Ô∏è extracting companies ‚û°Ô∏è mapping to tickers ‚û°Ô∏è fetching intraday prices ‚û°Ô∏è resampling to daily ‚û°Ô∏è forecasting with TimeGPT.
Designed and tested a basic version of **Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA)** to align stock price behavior relative to positive sentiment news events.
Prepared and prototyped a **Streamlit app** layout for future deployment.
Saved structured outputs into CSVs for future visualization and backtesting.

üå± Bud ‚Äì Looking forward to:
Deploying the first working version of the Stocex app on **Streamlit Cloud**.
Adding multi-ticker SEA visualization support and dynamic parameter adjustments (window size, sentiment threshold) directly in the UI.
Exploring real-time alert integration (e.g., sending daily stock signals based on news + forecast combination).

ü•Ä Thorn ‚Äì Challenges:
Some tickers fetched from NewsAPI headlines (e.g., non-S&P 500 small caps) caused yfinance fetch failures ‚Äî added error handling but still needs optimization.
Chronos library setup encountered conflicts with local environment versions (especially on Colab), needed fallback to direct TimeGPT API.
SEA testing limited by the availability of recent news events (many were future-dated or lacked sufficient price history).

üí≠ Additional thought:
Modularizing the code into clear functional scripts has proven very beneficial for scaling.
Need to finalize automatic sentiment labeling (positive/negative) for better SEA differentiation.
Deployment is ready ‚Äî only **final step pending** is pushing the app to Streamlit Cloud.
Focus next week: go live and refine visualizations for multi-ticker comparison.
