## 🧩 What is Stocex?

**Stocex** is a lightweight yet powerful Python script that scans daily financial headlines, scores their sentiment using FinBERT, detects affected stocks, fetches intraday price data, forecasts future prices using TimeGPT, and generates actionable trade signals.

## ⚙️ How It Works

> 🧠 Just run one script and everything happens automatically.

### 🔁 Pipeline Overview

1. **Fetch News (via NewsAPI):**  
   Get yesterday’s market headlines from Bloomberg, WSJ, CNBC, etc.

2. **Sentiment Scoring (FinBERT):**  
   Use HuggingFace FinBERT to score each headline (positive, neutral, negative)

3. **Company Detection (spaCy):**  
   Extract mentioned companies using Named Entity Recognition (NER)

4. **Ticker Mapping:**  
   Match company names to real stock tickers (e.g., Apple → AAPL)

5. **Intraday Price Data (yfinance):**  
   Download 5-minute historical data for last 30 days for each ticker

6. **Forecasting (TimeGPT-1):**  
   Forecast next 12 bars (1 hour) using Nixtla’s TimeGPT-1 API

7. **Signal Generation:**  
   Combine sentiment and forecast direction:
   - ✅ BUY = positive sentiment & forecast up
   - ❌ SELL = negative sentiment & forecast down
   - 🤝 HOLD = neutral or conflicting signals

8. **Output:**  
   Prints signal for each ticker (e.g., `AAPL: BUY`, `TSLA: HOLD`)
